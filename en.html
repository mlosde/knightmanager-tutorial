<h1 id="welcome-to-the-knight-manager-tutorial">Welcome to the Knight Manager Tutorial</h1>
<p>This tutorial is designed to help beginners get started in the world of Knight Manager. The tutorial can be used either as a step-by-step guide to the game or as a reference for game-related matters.<br />
To quickly navigate to a section, use the table of contents at the top of this page.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-knight-manager">What is Knight Manager</h2>
<p>Knight Manager is an audio-based game for Amazon Alexa devices. The game is controlled exclusively through voice commands. The interaction always takes place with your Echo device and the Knight Manager Alexa skill. In addition to the game, there is also a [website](https://www.knight-manager.com/) where you can gather information about your knight, view the battle and hunting rankings, and find news about the game. It also provides organized information about provinces, orders, and legends. If you're currently feeling lost, don't worry. We haven't even started the actual game yet. :-)<br />
If you don't own an Echo device, you can alternatively play the game through the Alexa app on your smartphone, tablet, or Windows PC. However, there are some limitations in this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>You won't be able to make in-skill purchases, such as buying diamonds.</li>
<li>The Dark Forest and automatic battles may not work or have limited functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, it is recommended to get an Echo device if you plan to play the game for an extended period and want to be successful.<br />
Sometimes during the game, you may not want to listen to the entire output of a given voice command. You can skip the output at any time by simply giving a new command. By doing this, you will only miss the audio output, as the calculations for that point in the game have already been completed. It is not necessary to let all outputs play through every time.<br />
If you ever didn't understand something, you can always have the output repeated. Just say "Repeat."</p>
    
<h2 id="creating-a-knight">Creating a Knight</h2>
<p>First, we need to create a knight, which will be your character that you'll play with. To do this, simply open the skill on your Echo device by saying, "Alexa, open Knight Manager." If you're using a different wake word, use that instead of "Alexa." Alternatively, on Echo devices with an action button, you can also give a voice command after pressing the button.<br />
Once the skill is opened, you'll hear the sound of a sword followed by a brief introduction. Now, follow the steps described there to give your knight a name. Afterward, your individual character will be created and you're ready to go.<br />
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: If you deactivate the skill and later reactivate it, a new knight will be created. So be careful with commands like "Deactivate Knight Manager," as Alexa will execute it without confirmation.</p>    

<h2 id="linking--your-knight-to-your-amazon-account">Linking Your Knight to Your Amazon Account</h2>
<p>Before you proceed, it's recommended to link your knight to your Amazon account. This has the advantage of earning you 10 diamonds as a reward for the account link every day, and it allows you to view your profile on the website later on. Additionally, linking your knight to your Amazon account provides an extra layer of security because if you deactivate and reactivate the skill, you can restore your knight by simply linking the skill to your Amazon account again.<br />
To link the skill to your account, open the Alexa app on your smartphone or tablet, go to the RitterManager skill page, and select "Settings." Then choose "Link Account" and follow the on-screen instructions on your device.</p>
<p><e3>IMPORTANT</e3>: In some cases, re-linking your Amazon account may not restore your knight but create a new one. If this is the case, you can contact the developers using the <a href="https://www.knight-manager.com/en/contact" target="_blank">contact form</a>.</p>
<h1 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h1>
<p>Now that everything is ready to get started, it's time to get a first overview of your knight and the world of Knight Manager in general.</p>
<h2 id="attributes-of-your-knight">Attributes of your Knight</h2>
<p>An essential part of the game is to continuously improve your knight's attributes, strengthening him for future challenges such as adventures or battles and ultimately leading him to success. To hear an overview of the characteristics, simply say "My knight". You will then have the option to learn more about the combat values or the hunting values. Alternatively, you can also say directly "My combat values" or "My hunting values".</p>
<h3 id="combat-attributes">Combat Attributes</h3>
<p>Your knight's combat attributes are the foundation for successful battles in the arena. Your knight has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health points: Health points determine how much damage your knight can take before he is defeated in a fight.
</li>
<li>Strength: The higher your strength, the more damage you do when you hit your opponent.
</li>
<li>Defense: Defense is the opposite attribute to strength. The higher it is, the less damage your opponent can do to you with one hit.</li>
<li>Luck: The higher the luck, the more likely you are to hit your opponent.</li>
<li>Speed: The higher your speed, the higher the chance you have of dodging your opponent. In addition, high speed gives you a higher chance of starting the fight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luck and speed also help you to get a small bonus to your damage or to reduce your opponent's damage a little. A good balance of your combat values ​​is therefore very important.</p>
<p>If you want to ask about one of these combat values, just say "My strength" or any other attribute to find out more about it. This will give you the exact breakdown between the base value, the additional points from bonus properties or temporary effects (e.g. from food), as well as the blacksmith upgrades for strength and defense and the upgrades in the Order Hall for luck and speed. This also means you don't have to listen to all the other values ​​if you only want to check a specific one.</p>
<h3 id="hunting-attributes">Hunting Attributes</h3>
<p>In addition to combat, there is another discipline in the game in which you can train your knight, the hunt in the Dark Forest. The following attributes can be trained here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakthrough power: Breakthrough power is used to calculate the damage you do when you hit an enemy while hunting.</li>
<li>Aiming: The higher the aiming, the more likely it is to hit an opponent while hunting.</li>
<li>Reading tracks: The better you are at reading tracks, the more often you will find an opponent while hunting.</li>
</ul>
<p>As in combat, a good distribution of points is crucial for successful results in hunting. The hunting characteristics can be queried at any time using the “My hunting values” command.</p>
<h3 id="special-skills">Special Skills</h3>
<p>In addition to the combat and hunting attributes, there are other special skills that your knight can acquire. Here, too, a distinction is made between combat and hunting. We will look at the skills in more detail later when we look at the shop and the hunting lodge.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-attributes">Bonus Attributes</h3>
<p>To help your knight succeed even more effectively, you can equip him with powerful bonus attributes. These either increase the attributes for combat or hunting by a few points or give you another advantage. Bonus attributes for combat are bought in the shop, those for hunting in the hunting lodge. The sections “Shop” and “Hunting lodge” provide more detailed information on the available bonus attributes.</p>
<h3 id="combat-class">Combat Class</h3>
<p>Finally, there is one last characteristic of your knight, the so-called combat class (division). Each combat class gives your knight an advantage and a special combat title (e.g. corporal). This can be heard later in many places in the game, for example in fights in the arena or when another player is looking for your knight.<br />
At the beginning, your character does not have a special combat title and is therefore not assigned to a combat class. Assignment to a class takes place every Wednesday at 12 noon CET during the combat class evaluation. Your game activity determines which combat class your knight is assigned to. The more you do in the game, the more active you are and the better you will do in the combat class evaluation. Everything that requires a command in the game counts as activity. Dark Forest or automatic combat also count slightly towards game activity.<br />
<em>ATTENTION</em>: Combat classes are dynamic and you can drop from a high to a lower one if you have been less active in a week. So if you want to keep your combat class or want to gradually move up, you should be accordingly active in the game.<br />
There are a total of 14 combat classes that give you the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scout: More experience in daily adventures</li>
<li>Corporal: Adventures cost your knight less energy</li>
<li>Sergeant: 5% more speed</li>
<li>Senior Sergeant: 5% more luck</li>
<li>First Sergeant: 10% discount at the blacksmith</li>
<li>Knight: More honor points by winning battles</li>
<li>Bloodguard: 5% more defense</li>
<li>Legionnaire: 10% more experience points in battles</li>
<li>Centurion: 5% more strength</li>
<li>Chapion: More diamonds for gifts from the king</li>
<li>Commander: 10% more gold per hour from your serfs</li>
<li>General: Allows you to purchase and use the epic combat ability “Bow Shot”</li>
<li>Warlord: Allows you to purchase and use the epic combat ability “Drain Life”</li>
<li>High Warlord: Allows you to purchase and use the epic combat ability “Curse of Agony”</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also check how active you are at the moment. To do this, simply say "My activity". You will then hear your activity rank. This determines how many combat class points you can receive in the combat class evaluation. Your combat class is then determined based on these combat class points. Unlike the activity, you cannot check the combat class points.<br />
  There are 14 of these activity ranks in total. However, your activity rank does not necessarily determine which combat class you will be promoted to or whether you will be relegated. However, you should make sure to reach at least an activity rank of 5 or higher, as 10% of the combat class points you have collected so far are lost every Wednesday and you are therefore highly unlikely to be relegated.</p>
<h2 id="other-important-building-blocks">Other Important Building Blocks</h2>
<p>In addition to the combat, hunting, and bonus characteristics, there are some other values ​​and building blocks of the game that are important for you and your knight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level: For every level your knight gains, you receive a skill point. You can use this to improve one of the attributes for combat. The level increases when you collect experience points. You receive these in combat, in daily adventures or in the black tower. One skill point improves the base value by 10 points, with the exception of health points, which increase by 20 per point.</li>
<li>Hunting Level: As in combat, once you reach a new hunting level, you can spend a skill point on a hunting trait. The hunting level increases as you gain experience points while hunting in the Dark Forest.</li>
<li>Honor: Your honor points determine your ranking. The more you have, the better your ranking in the knight rankings. You get honor points by winning battles. If you lose a battle, however, you also lose some honor points.</li>
<li>Gold: This is the main currency in the game. There is no limit to how much gold you can have.</li>
<li>Serfs(Servants): Serfs produce new gold for you every hour. You can steal serfs from other knights in battle, for example, or get them in the Dark Tower, at the fair, or during daily adventures and in the Dark Forest.</li>
<li>Arrow Maker: The arrow makers produce arrows for you every hour, which are needed for hunting in the Dark Forest. You can find out more about the arrow makers in the “Arrow Factory” section.</li>
<li>Energy: Many actions in the game cost your knight energy points. You get additional energy every hour, unless you have reached the maximum possible energy. Say "my energy" for more information. You can also buy energy at any time with diamonds and even beyond your maximum energy.</li>
<li>Diamonds: Diamonds are very valuable. They can be found in the game or bought with real money. With them you can, for example, unlock upgrades at the blacksmith without having to wait, buy bonus features and skills in the shop or recharge your knight with new energy if you don't want to wait for the next hour.</li>
<li>Player number: This number uniquely identifies your knight and helps with technical problems or when searching for players if another knight cannot find you using your name. It is best to write down this number so that you have it to hand in case of emergency.</li>
</ul>
<p>To check one of these values, say "my gold" or any of the other values mentioned. You will then receive some useful information about it.<br />
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: To check your ranking position and your honor points, say "my combat division". The commands "honor", "my honor points" or "my honor" will not be accepted.</p>
<h3 id="seasons">Seasons</h3>
<p>To ensure that things don't get boring in Knight Manager, the game is round-based. A round is referred to as a season. Each season lasts 210 days. This gives every player the opportunity to compete under fair conditions, even against long-standing players. The central component of the season's progression is the order. The "Orders" section goes into detail about the end of a season and the start of a new season.</p>
<h3 id="leaderboard">Leaderboard</h3>
<p>Here is some information about the ranking system in Knight Manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Knight Ranking is divided into four leagues: League A, B, C and D</li>
<li>Honor points determine your place in the rankings</li>
<li>League A includes the top 50 players based on honor points</li>
<li>League B includes places 51 to 150 measured by honor points, so there are a total of 100 places in League B</li>
<li>League C includes places 151 to 300 measured by honor points, so there are a total of 150 places in League C</li>
<li>League D includes all other players. The ranking here is also determined by the honor points.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to find out the best knights in the skill, just say “Top 10”. Alternatively, you have the option of viewing the rankings clearly on the Knight Manager website.</p>
<h4 id="special-features-of-the-rookie-rank">Special features of the rookie rank</h4>
<p>As a newcomer, you only compete with the players who are in the rookie rankings with you. This gives you the opportunity to fight in a fair environment as a beginner and to try things out in peace. Unlike the regular rankings, the rookie rankings have a few special features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players from the regular rankings cannot attack you, even if they are specifically looking for you</li>
<li>The rookie ranking includes its own four leagues A to D</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, as a beginner, you can interact with other players from the regular rankings as normal. From the next season, you will automatically play in the regular rankings.</p>
<h1 id="core-gameplay-elements">Core Gameplay Elements</h1>
<p>Now that you know about your knight's attributes, we can now focus on the important things in the everyday life of a knight manager. The core gameplay elements of the game are explained in detail below. If you already have some experience and are looking for a specific place or building block of the game, just use the navigation at the top of this page.</p>
<h2 id="adventures">Adventures</h2>
<p>Now that you know the basics, it's time to start with the daily routine of the Knight Manager, and this usually starts with a daily adventure.<br />
The daily adventures are a small story line in the game. The process is always the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every day at 12 noon CET there is a new adventure if you successfully master the current one</li>
<li>AAdventures begin with a short story and end with a fight against a fictional character, i.e. an NPC</li>
<li>Each adventure brings you a small reward such as gold, diamonds or serfs as well as some experience points</li>
</ul>
<p>To go on the daily adventure, simply say "adventure". Your knight will now go in search of an adventure and the actual story begins. Each attempt costs your knight 5 energy points, provided you have not yet been assigned a combat class. From combat class 2 (Corporal) onwards, only 2 energy points are deducted.<br />
If you are unsuccessful in an adventure, you can simply try again. You only have to wait until the next day if you have successfully mastered the adventure and you can go on a new adventure.<br />
If you have gone up a level after completing an adventure, you can also immediately distribute a skill point.</p>
<h3 id="prestige-mode">Prestige Mode</h3>
<p>There are currently 100 adventures in Knight Manager. So that you can continue to go on daily adventures even after completing the 100th adventure, the so-called prestige mode comes into play after adventure 100.<br />
In prestige mode, the story line starts again from the beginning, but the rewards are 20% higher and the enemies are a bit stronger.</p>
<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>Now that you've learned about the adventures, it's important to get to grips with the core part of the game: combat. Battles take place in the arena and you fight against other players in your area on the leaderboard. Winning battles earns you honor points, which you can use to improve your position on the leaderboard, as well as experience points, which are important for leveling up. When you lose battles, you always lose a few honor points, but you still get experience points.<br />
To start a battle, just say "battle" or "fight". Like the adventures, each battle costs 5 energy points.</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-a-battle">Structure of a Battle</h3>
<p>A fight consists of three turns. So everyone has three rounds to make it clear to the opponent who is in charge.<br />
However, if you or your opponent inflicts more damage than the opponent's health points, the fight ends early. Otherwise, at the end of the fight, the remaining percentage of your knights' total health points decides. So, for example, if your opponent has 100 health points and you inflict a total of 20 damage on him, but he only inflicts 10 damage on you with 100 health points, you win the fight because you still have 90% of your health points left, while your opponent only has 80%. If one of the opponents manages to inflict more than 100 damage before the end of the four rounds, the fight ends early and the one who was able to take all of the opponent's health points wins.<br />
After the fight, you will hear how many honor points you have won or lost, how much experience you have gained, and whether you were able to steal any serfs from your opponent. If you have leveled up, you can also assign a skill point.<br />
<em>TIP</em>: You can also say "My Level" at any time to find out if you still have free skill points left.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT</em>: If you start a fight and lose, no serfs can be stolen from you. However, if someone attacks you, serfs can be stolen from you. After opening the skill, you will find out if you were attacked while you were away.</p>
<h3 id="king's-gifts">King's Gifts</h3>
<p>Sometimes the king will reward you with a small gift after you win a battle. These gifts contain either diamonds, tickets for the fair or provincial coins for the provincial battle. You can find out more about byes in the “Fair” section and about provincial coins in the “Provincial Battle” section.</p>
<h3 id="combat-modes">Combat Modes</h3>
<p>There are two combat modes in total, which determine in which environment an opponent is sought based on your ranking position:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal: Here an opponent is searched for in the range of plus or minus 10 places based on your ranking position</li>
<li>Random opponent: Here an opponent is searched for in the range of plus or minus 100 places based on your ranking position</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot influence whether the random or normal mode is used. However, the normal battle mode is used more and more.</p>
<h3 id="quick-fight">Quick Fight</h3>
<p>You've probably already noticed that a single fight takes a long time for the audio output. If you want things to go faster, you can also use the "quick fight" command. This ensures that only who you are fighting against and whether you won or lost is announced. As with a regular fight, you also receive a report at the end about the honor points you have gained or lost, the experience points you have gained and possibly about serfs you have stolen from your opponent. Gifts from the king are of course also announced.</p>
<p><em>TIP</em>: Experienced players often don't listen to the fights until the end, but start the next quick fight immediately when the battle melody sounds. This allows you to invest significantly more energy in fights in a short time and increase effectiveness.</p>
<h3 id="auto-fight">Auto Fight</h3>
<p>From level 100, you also have the option of using automatic combat. This means you don't have to say "fight" or "quick fight" every time to look for a new opponent, but can simply send your knight into the arena. He will then fight until his energy is used up or you end his stay in the arena with the command "stop".<br />
After opening the skill, you will hear a summary of your stay in the arena. Here you will find out whether you were able to improve your ranking, how many experience points you have collected and how many levels you have climbed. Then, if you were able to climb a level, you have the option of awarding one or more skill points.<br />
To start automatic combat, simply say "auto fight" or "auto battle".</p>
<h2 id="blacksmith">Blacksmith</h2>
<p>In the fundamentals, you've already heard about blacksmith upgrades. Skill points aren't the only way to improve your knight's attributes. They just form the basis of your stats. Strength and defense can be increased by upgrading your sword and armor at the blacksmith. To visit the blacksmith, just say "blacksmith".<br />
You will then be greeted by the blacksmith and can choose one of the following upgrades:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword: Each level you upgrade your sword increases your base strength by 1%</li>
<li>Armor: Each level you upgrade your armor increases your base defense by 1%</li>
<li>Accommodations: With each level you upgrade your accommodations, you can accommodate 125 more serfs</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, to hear what your base stats are, just say "My Strength" or another attribute. You will also hear by what percentage the base stat is increased by upgrades at the blacksmith. To hear how many serfs you can currently accommodate, say "My Gold".</p>
<p>Upgrades at the blacksmith are paid for with gold. The higher the level of an upgrade, the more expensive it becomes. As a reminder: serfs produce new gold pieces for you every hour. You should therefore make sure that you have a good cushion of serfs, especially at the beginning, and also expand your accommodation a little so that you can accommodate the serfs. Otherwise, serfs that you receive in the tower or in battle, for example, would be lost because they cannot find space in your accommodation if it is already full.<br />
The higher the level of an upgrade at the blacksmith, the longer it takes. An upgrade takes no longer than 12 hours at most. If you have reached this value for the duration of an upgrade, the time that the upgrade takes does not increase at the next level.<br />
If you do not want to wait for an upgrade to be completed, you can also unlock it directly with a small amount of diamonds. This also increases with the level of the upgrade, but the maximum amount required for immediate unlocking is no more than 50 diamonds.<br />
Wenn das Upgrade abgeschlossen ist, gibt dir der Schmied im Skill
When the upgrade is complete, the blacksmith will let you know in the skill. You can also say “blacksmith” at any time to see how long the upgrade will take.</p>
<h2 id="shop">Shop</h2>
<p>The shop is another important part of the game, in addition to the battle to level up and improve your position on the leaderboard. You can use it to equip your knight with new special combat skills and bonus properties.<br />
All products in the shop are paid for with diamonds. As a reminder: you can find diamonds in the game or buy them with real money at any time.<br />
The offer in the shop changes every day at 12 noon CET and is the same for every player. Each day you can always choose between one combat skill, one bonus property and one title. However, there are limits for skills and bonus properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can buy a maximum of one skill per day</li>
<li>You can buy a maximum of 15 bonus features per day</li>
</ul>
<p>The title has no effect in battle, it is only announced after the name of your knight in battles, when searching for players and in some other places in the game and thus serves solely to personalize your knight.</p>
<p>To go to the shop, just say “shop”.</p>
<h3 id="combat-skills">Combat Skills</h3>
<p>To make the battle more dynamic and exciting, you can equip your knight with special combat skills. You can only use a maximum of three skills at a time in battle. You can find out which skills your knight is currently using by saying “change skills” and then “combat skills”. Alternatively, you can also say “change combat skills” directly.<br />
Each combat skill is available in three levels, with each level increasing the effectiveness of the skill. At the beginning, the skills are only available in level 1. Due to the limit of being able to buy a maximum of one skill per day, you have to wait for levels 2 and 3 until the skill is available again in the shop.<br />
In addition, there are three skills that can only be bought and used with certain combat classes. These are called epic skills. If you have already bought one of these skills but are not currently in the required combat class, you cannot use the epic skill in battle.<br />
By default, a purchased combat skill is activated immediately. Unless you have already bought more than three different combat skills. From then on, you must first activate newly acquired skills before your knight can use them.<br />
When the skills are used in battle depends on the chance of the respective skill. Below you will find an overview of all available combat skills.</p>

<h2 id="player-search">Player Search</h2>
<p>To interact with other players, you can find them either by name or by player number. To use the player search, simply say "Search for" followed by the player name.<br />
If you want to search for a player number, say "Search for number" followed by the player number instead. You can say the player number either as a whole word or as a sequence of numbers.<br />
When you have found the player you want, say "yes" and you will be given the following interaction options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack: This function allows you to attack a player directly. Direct attacks are limited to 3 per day (starting at 12 noon CET). It does not matter whether you directly attack the same player three times or three different opponents.</li>
<li>Send a gift: This feature is explained in more detail in the “Mailbox” section.</li>
<li>Write a letter, if available: This feature is explained in more detail in the “Mailbox” section.</li>
<li>Suggest a trade: This feature is explained in more detail in the “Trade” section.</li>
<li>Send a request for a tag team: We'll look at this feature in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can see that Knight Manager also places a lot of value on mutual interaction. Some functions, which will now be explained step by step, also involve the player search. It is therefore important to know these now, even if you do not yet know the interaction options themselves.</p>
<h2 id="tag-team">Tag-Team</h2>
<p>In addition to your combat stats, the blacksmith upgrades and the upgrade options in the shop, you can also get support from another knight in battle, in daily adventures, in the Black Tower or even in the Dark Forest. When two knights join forces, they form what is known as a tag team.<br />
Many experienced players are already in a tag team with other knights, so it's best to try to find a tag team partner via the official Discord server for the game or the official Facebook group and don't just search for players to ask them questions. The links to the Facebook group and the Discord server can be found on the <a href="https://www.knight-manager.com/">Knight Manager Website</a>.</p>
<p>In order to support each other, you must be online at the same time. Then, in battle, on an adventure, or in the Black Tower, your tag team partner may come to your aid and try to take down your opponent. So it makes sense to look for a stronger tag team partner at the beginning. Fortunately, the community is very helpful and will be happy to help you.<br />
Tag teams are also not permanent. They can be disbanded and re-formed as often as you like. This means that you may be temporarily supported by a particularly strong knight if you are up against a particularly difficult opponent, e.g. in the Black Tower. Feel free to ask for support here on the official Discord server or in the official Facebook group.</p>
<p>If you have received a tag team request yourself, you will be automatically informed of this in the game; for example, after opening the skill. You can then decide whether you want to accept or reject the request.</p>
<p>If you want to find out who you are currently in a tag team with, just say “My Tag Team”.</p>
<h2 id="backpack">Backpack</h2>
<p>Of course, in Knight Manager there is also an inventory for your character, the backpack. Here you will find all the items that your knight currently owns in addition to his gold, diamonds, serfs and arrow makers.<br />
To open the backpack, simply say “backpack”. You can then choose between several categories, for example consumable or food. After you have selected a category, you will hear the items assigned to it. You then have the option of selecting an item to learn more about it. You can also then interact with it, for example equip it, use it or, in the case of food, eat it. The available options are announced for each item.<br />
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: When you equip an item, all items of this type are automatically equipped. So if you equip a thorium spear and you have several of them, they will be used until they are all used up. So never forget to unequip items again if you only want to use a few of them for a short moment.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT</em>: For a few items, you may also hear that they are soulbound. This means that you cannot pass them on to other knights, for example via the gift or trade function.<br />
In the "Overview of all items" section you will also find an overview of all items currently available in Knight Manager.</p>
<h3 id="special-considerations-for-food">Special Considerations for Food</h3>
<p>Food cannot be consumed an unlimited number of times in a row, as it can lead to poisoning. The only exceptions are apples and apple pie, which can be eaten an unlimited number of times. However, they only give you the full value of energy as long as you can consume it. Otherwise, if you still want to eat the apple or apple pie, you only get the number of energy points that you still need to reach your maximum energy from your feather beds.<br />
How much of a food your knight can eat in a row depends on your resistance. This increases if your knight eats too much and suffers poisoning as a result, and applies to all foods except apples and apple pie.</p>
<p>After your knight has eaten something, the risk of poisoning gradually decreases. If your knight warns you that he is already feeling sick and you do not want to cause poisoning, you must wait a while before consuming food again.</p>
<p><em>TIP</em>: A high resistance is not unimportant. So try to increase the resistance with poisoning if you want your knight to eat more food in a short period of time in the future.</p>
<h2 id="castle-garden">Castle Garden</h2>
<p>The castle garden is the central point of contact for special events in the kingdom. Sometimes the king organizes special competitions or other events, which you can find out about in the castle garden. In addition to the notices about the current event, there are two other areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules: If you say “rules” in the castle garden, you will hear the rules of the current event</li>
<li>Ranking: If you say “Ranking” in the castle garden, you will learn more about the current leaders and your position in an event, if there is a ranking
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should visit the castle gardens regularly so you don't miss any special events.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is also a traveling merchant in the castle gardens with whom you can exchange royal medals for valuable items. You can exchange the following items for your collected medals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two treasure chests and matching keys for a medal</li>
<li>A dragon egg for two medals</li>
<li>A magic watch that stops time in battle for three medals</li>
</ul>
<p>You receive medals if you are in the top 5 in the combat or hunting rankings or if you are a member of the winner's order. You can therefore receive a maximum of two medals per season.</p>
<h2 id="knights-games">Knights Games</h2>
<p>The Kinghts Games take place every Saturday throughout the day. To take part, you choose one of three guilds on Friday that you would like to join. On Saturday, you and your guild must then collect as many honor points as possible in regular battles. Lost honor points have no negative impact, only the honor points gained are added together.<br />
Participation in the Kinghts Games costs 25 diamonds. Normally, you will be automatically asked on Friday after opening the skill whether you would like to take part. Otherwise, you can also say “Kinghts Games” to select a guild.<br />
While the Kinghts Games take place on Saturday, you can also say “Kinghts Games” at any time to find out where your guild is currently ranked.</p>
<h3 id="awards-ceremony">Awards Ceremony</h3>
<p>The award ceremony for the Kinghts Games takes place on Sunday. Depending on the placement, different prizes are available:<br />
The guild that comes first receives the diamonds that were used. These are then divided among the members of the winning guild. There is also some gold and silver arrows.<br />
The guild that comes second does not receive any diamonds, but does receive gold and silver arrows.<br />
The guild that comes third, on the other hand, only receives some gold.<br />
So you can see that you can only win at the Kinghts Games. It is therefore definitely worth choosing one of the three guilds every Friday.</p>
<h2 id="fun-fair">Fun Fair</h2>
<p>Before we get to the next core discipline besides combat, namely hunting in the Dark Forest, there is another important place, the fun fair.<br />
The fun fair comes to town every Tuesday. You then have the opportunity to spin the wheel and win great prizes.<br />
To get to the fun fair, just say “fun fair”.<br />
If you have any tickets, you can now use them on the wheel. In total, you have the choice between three spin speeds: soft, medium or strong.<br />
If you no longer have any tickets, you can also pay five diamonds per spin.<br />
There is also the option, if you still have tickets, to buy more tickets via the backpack. To do this, simply look for the tickets in your backpack. You will then be asked if you would like to buy more tickets.</p>
<p>The following prizes can be won at the fun fair:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy: <em>IMPORTANT</em>: You gain energy even if you have already reached your maximum energy, so by gaining energy at the fun fair you can store more energy than your maximum energy</li>
<li>Objects</li>
<li>Serfs</li>
<li>Tickets</li>
<li>Diamonds</li>
<li>Combat Bonus Attributes (Rare)</li>
<li>Scrolls (Very Rare)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, every spin in which you don't win a combat bonus attribute increases the chance of winning one on the next spin. It is precisely because of the bonus attributes that it is important to visit the fun fair every Tuesday and not miss out on the prizes. But the other resources are always very useful, and you can also trade items that you may not necessarily need with other players.</p>
<h2 id="dark-forest">Dark Forest</h2>
<p>In addition to combat, there is another important core discipline in which you should train your knight: hunting in the Dark Forest. The forest is available to you from level 5.<br />
There is also a ranking list for hunting, where the number of kills of orcs and other enemies determines your position. You can hear your position on the hunting ranking list at irregular intervals in the Dark Forest. Alternatively, you can simply say “hunting ranking list” in the skill.<br />
The types of orcs or other creatures found in the forest depend on your hunting level. The higher the hunting level, the stronger orcs your knight can track down.</p>
<p>In the Dark Forest, arrows are the main ammunition. If your knight has no arrows, you will be notified after you say “the Dark Forest” and can buy a small package of 200 silver arrows for 20 diamonds. Later, the arrow makers will produce the arrows for you. Each arrow maker produces one silver arrow every hour. You can also buy quivers with a supply of silver arrows in the hunting lodge.<br />
Your knight will now hunt in the Dark Forest until he has no more arrows or you end the hunt. You can do this either with the “stop” command or simply by opening the skill.<br />
When the hunt has ended and you open the skill again, you will also find out how many orcs you were able to kill on your last hunt and how many gold pieces you received. If you have been able to advance one or more levels, you can also directly award one or more hunting skill points.<br />
<em>TIP</em>: You can also say “My Hunting Level” at any time to see if you have any free Hunting Skill Points left.</p>
<p>In addition to the actual hunt, there is much more to discover in the forest. For example, your knight can find items such as apples, wild mushrooms or even some berries, which are then placed in your backpack. So after a long stay in the forest, it is worth checking your backpack to see what nice things your knight has found.<br />
In addition, while you are in the Dark Forest, you will hear announcements about the game, for example when a hunting or fighting tournament is about to start or your blacksmith has finished an upgrade.</p>
<h3 id="the-orc-king">The Orc King</h3>
<p>The most important creature in the Dark Forest is the orc king. the Dark Forest is only open as long as he is alive. If a knight manages to kill the orc king, he will receive a handsome bounty in the form of diamonds. The knight who kills the king also receives a blueprint for a wolf cloak. Otherwise, the bounty increases by a few diamonds every day at midnight.<br />
If the orc king is killed, you have to wait until midnight the next day until the new king returns and you can enter the forest again.<br />
Your knight can only shoot the orc king with arrows. Other ammunition will not be used, even if it is equipped.</p>
<h3 id="health-points-in-the-forest">Health Points in the Forest</h3>
<p>When you entered the forest, you probably noticed that health points were also announced in addition to the number of silver arrows. The health points in the forest are your knight's total health points, which you already know from combat.<br />
A high number of health points is important in the forest, as orcs can attack you if you miss them or if you can't kill them with one hit because you don't do enough damage. If you lose health points in the forest due to attacks from orcs, this does not affect the combat; so if you have suffered damage in the forest, you still have your normal health points available in combat.<br />
There are various ways to replenish your health points in the forest:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have found forest mushrooms and equipped them. Your knight will eat a forest mushroom if he is 10% or more behind on his health points.</li>
<li>You have made fried mushrooms. Your knight will eat these fried mushrooms whenever he is 75% or more health points short in the forest.</li>
<li>Another knight rushes to your aid and heals you with healing herbs</li>
<li>A hunting tournament starts for which you have registered</li>
<li>Your tag team partner is currently in the forest and can find you faster than other knights and heal you with healing herbs, provided he has some</li>
<li>You have one or more salads of resurrection and have equipped them. Your knight eats this salad as soon as he has no more health points</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="healing-knights">Healing Knights</h3>
<p>Like finding orcs, the process of finding wounded knights is automatic. If you have healing herbs and have them equipped and then find a wounded knight, your knight will help him with a healing herb.<br />
Healing herbs can rarely be found in the remains of orcs or through the hunting skill "Herbalism". You can find out more about hunting skills in the "Hunting Lodge" section.<br />
If you run out of healing herbs and find new ones, you do not have to equip them again if they were already equipped. This should help you not to have to leave the forest all the time and to be able to heal knights immediately when healing herbs are found.</p>
<h3 id="the-night-in-the-dark-forest">The Night in the Dark Forest</h3>
<p>During the night (9pm to 6am) there are a few special features in the forest:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can find special orcs if you have reached the necessary hunting level</li>
<li>Special background noise</li>
</ul>
<p>At 6 o'clock the orcs that appeared during the night are burned and cannot be found during the day.</p>
<h3 id="orc-plagues">Orc Plagues</h3>
<p>Sometimes it can happen that a type of orc spreads particularly strongly in the Dark Forest. In the game, this is referred to as a plague.<br />
The plagues are announced both in the skill and in the Dark Forest during the hunt. During a plague, your knight will mostly encounter the corresponding type of orc that is currently responsible for a plague.<br />
If your knight has not yet reached the required hunting level for the type of orc that is causing a plague, he will continue to only find the orcs visible for his level range.</p>
<h3 id="wolf-hunt">Wolf Hunt</h3>
<p>In addition to tracking down orcs, it is also possible to lure certain enemies in the Dark Forest with special items. Currently, the only enemy that needs to be lured with bait in order to be tracked down is the wolf.<br />
In order to find wolves, your knight must use wolf bait. Wolves are extremely difficult to hit and have a lot of health points. If you have wolf bait, you should wait until you have become stronger in the forest.<br />
For every wolf you kill, you will receive a wolf pelt.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT</em>: Wolves can only be shot with arrows. It is also possible to use hunting skills.</p>
<h3 id="hunting-tournaments">Hunting Tournaments</h3>
<p>If you can find your way around the forest well, you should take a look at the hunting tournaments. Here you can prove your hunting skills against other knights and assert yourself in various disciplines.<br />
Hunting tournaments, if one takes place, are announced in the skill and in the forest ten minutes before the start. The tournaments then start on the hour and last 30 minutes.<br />
To register for a hunting tournament, open the skill and say “hunting tournament”. You will then hear the entry fee you have to pay. If you decide to take part, confirm the question with “yes”. After that, you should go to the Dark Forest. The task will then be announced automatically shortly after the tournament starts.<br />
As with the regular hunt, your knight moves around the forest autonomously during the tournaments. The kills are also calculated as normal.<br />
During the hunting tournament, you will hear at irregular intervals what position you are currently in. After the hunting tournament has ended, you can simply open the skill to hear the award ceremony.<br />
At the end of a hunting tournament, the three best participants receive a prize based on the diamonds they used. First place receives 50%, second place 40% and third place 10% of the diamonds.<br />
Every Monday, a hunting tournament takes place every hour in the game. However, the participation fee is twice as high as on other days.</p>
<p><em>TIP</em>: There are items that temporarily increase your knight's hunting abilities. After the hunting tournament task has been announced, you can also briefly leave the forest to change hunting abilities or equip appropriate items or eat food.</p>
<h3 id="overview-of-all-creatures-in-the-dark-forest">Overview of All Creatures in the Dark Forest</h3>

</table>
<p><em>IMPORTANT</em>: Since your knight automatically moves around the forest, it is recommended that you go to the Dark Forest whenever you are not actively playing the game. After entering the forest overnight, you can simply set the volume on your Echo device to 0, but the knight will continue to hunt orcs and you can spend your hunting skill points the next morning and check the items in your backpack.</p>
<h2 id="tavern">Tavern</h2>
<p>Aside from the fighting and hunting, the tavern is an important sideshow in the game. Here you have the opportunity to play cards against Joe (Blackjack) or to upgrade your knight for a certain period of time with potions.<br />
To get to the tavern, simply say “Tavern”. Now you have the choice between going to the bar or playing cards.<br />
<em>TIP</em>: You can also say “Bar” or “Play Cards” directly without going to the tavern. But this only works once you have used the “Tavern” command once and have already played the story in the tavern.</p>
<h3 id="bar">Bar</h3>
<p>The most important element in the tavern is the bar. From Marcel, the barkeeper, you can buy a mug of beer and up to three potions every day, which give your knight a certain advantage for an hour. As in the shop, the offer here changes daily at 12 noon CET.<br />
It is possible to use several potions at once, but you cannot activate two potions of the same type at the same time.<br />
The potions at the bar are paid for with gold and are automatically activated after purchase. The mug of beer is free, but has no effect on your knight.<br />
There are 30 quality levels for each potion. The higher the level of a potion, the greater the effect.<br />
Below you will find an overview of all potions:</p>

</table>
<p><em>TIP</em>: When you select a potion, you can also just say the attribute instead of the full name of the potion. For example, you can select the Battle Potion of Strength with the command “Strength” or the Ancient War Potion with the command “Experience”.</p>
<h3 id="playing-cards">Playing Cards</h3>
<p>If you have a lot of gold left over and want to risk it on a round of blackjack, Rafael is the place to be. Say “play cards” to join Joe at the table and the games can begin.</p>
<h2 id="dark-tower">Dark Tower</h2>
<p>From level 10, in addition to fighting and hunting in the Dark Forest, you also have the option of sending your knight to the Dark Tower. However, this is only available when Azrael, the evil magician, tries to take control of the kingdom.<br />
To get to the Dark Tower, simply say “Dark Tower”.</p>
<p>In the tower you fight against fictional characters. These are located on the various levels of the tower. The aim is to climb as many levels as possible to reach the last level and thus the evil magician Azrael and defeat him. Each fight in the tower costs your knight 5 energy points.<br />
On each level you meet an opponent, every tenth level is called a boss level.<br />
If you win a fight in the tower, you receive experience points as well as serfs, gold and diamonds.<br />
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: From level 200 onwards, bosses in the tower can no longer be defeated with the “Pierce” or “Bow Shot (Headshot at level 3)” skills. So it is best to adapt your combat skills for boss levels above level 200. To do this, use the “Change combat skills” command.</p>
<h3 id="attack-on-the-kingdom">Attack on the Kingdom</h3>
<p>Every day at 2 p.m. CET the status of the Dark Tower is updated and the progress of the preparations for the attack on our kingdom increases. From the second update (usually 48 hours after the Tower awakens) it is possible for Azrael to be defeated in direct combat by a knight before the attack on the kingdom begins. If a knight manages to fight his way to the top of the tower and defeat Azrael, the Dark Tower is then abandoned and the winner receives the legendary Thunder Sword. This rare artifact makes it possible to use the legendary ability "Thunderclap".<br />
However, knights rarely succeed in defeating Azrael directly. Usually the magician completes his preparations about two weeks after the Tower awakens and the attack on the kingdom begins.<br />
From then on, every knight has the opportunity to attack Azrael with the "Dark Tower" command and put him to flight.<br />
If the knight community manages to defeat Azrael within 24 hours of the attack starting, the one who delivers the final blow will receive the Thunder Sword. All others who have also attacked Azrael will receive a small reward from the king in the form of 300 diamonds.<br />
If the knights fail to stop Azrael, he will kidnap the king from the kingdom. After that, they will have to wait until a new king is crowned. During the time the king is absent, there are no gifts for winning battles.<br />
Inboth cases, the tower is deserted after the spectacle and Azrael will return again in the foreseeable future to take over the kingdom.</p>
<h2 id="arrow-factory">Arrow Factory</h2>
<p>You've heard of arrow makers a lot by now. You've probably already wondered how you get arrow makers. This is possible via the arrow factory, which is available to you from level 15.<br />
Brigitte, the name of the owner of the arrow factory, can try to train your knight's serfs to become arrow makers. To visit the arrow factory, say "arrow factory".<br />
You can then decide whether and how many serfs you want to send for training. For the greatest possible success, it is recommended that you always send 100 serfs to the arrow factory for each training session. So if you want to convert 1,000 serfs into arrow makers, for example, you should send 100 serfs to training 10 times instead of 1,000 at once. It should also be noted that at least 100 serfs must be sent to the arrow factory for each training session.<br />
After training, the arrow makers are immediately available to you and from then on produce new arrows for you every hour. Unlike serfs, these cannot be stolen from you and there is no limit to how many arrow makers you can employ.</p>
<h2 id="hunting-lodge">Hunting Lodge</h2>
<p>As in battle, there is also the option to equip your knight with additional hunting skills and hunting bonus properties when hunting in the Dark Forest. The offer in the hunting lodge also changes daily at 12 noon CET. There are always three products available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hunting Skill</li>
<li>Hunting Bonus Attribute</li>
<li>Quiver with silver arrows</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike in the shop, hunting skills and bonus attributes are paid for with arrow makers. Quivers, on the other hand, cost your knight a certain amount of diamonds.<br />
Wie auch im Shop gilt, dass du pro Tag nur eine Fähigkeit kaufen kannst.
As in the shop, you can only buy one skill per day. However, there is no limit to the number of other products you can buy per day.</p>
<h3 id="hunting-skills">Hunting Skills</h3>
<p>There are no epic skills for hunting that require a certain requirement to be met in order to purchase or use them. However, there is one thing they have in common with combat: a maximum of three skills can be active at any one time when hunting. To switch between active hunting skills, simply say “Change hunting skills” or “Set hunting ability”.<br />
There are also different levels for hunting skills. The effectiveness of the hunting ability increases with each level.<br />
Unless you have already purchased three different hunting skills, hunting skills are activated immediately after purchase. You only have to explicitly activate them from the fourth and all hunting skills acquired in the future.</p>
<p>When a hunting skill is used depends on its chance. Below you will find an overview of all hunting skills.</p>

<h2 id="mailbox">Mailbox</h2>
<p>In your mailbox you will find letters and gifts that other knights or fictional characters in the game, such as the king, have sent you. To get to the mailbox, say “mailbox”.<br />
If you have new gifts or letters, this will also be announced in the skill. When you say “mailbox”, the first letter or package will be opened automatically.</p>
<h3 id="sending-gifts">Sending Gifts</h3>
<p>If you want to send a gift to a player, you must first search for a player. To do this, use the player search by searching for either the player name or the player number<br />
Then select "Send gift" from the options. You will then be asked what you want to send.<br />
<em>TIP</em>: If you want to send something from your backpack, you can also name any item directly when asked what you want to send.<br />
Once you have stated the number of resources you want to give away, you will receive a summary of your package again and can then send it.<br />
Once you have sent the gift, it will take about an hour for the package to arrive in the recipient's mailbox. If you have reached your daily gift limit, the delivery time will increase and you will receive a corresponding notification. How many gifts you can send per day with a fixed delivery time of one hour depends on your combat class.<br />
If you want to shorten the transport time, you can also bribe the messenger with 5 diamonds. Your package will then arrive at the recipient within the next 5 minutes. This works even if your gift limit has already been reached.</p>
<h3 id="writing-letters">Writing Letters</h3>
<p>If you want to write a letter to another player, you can also use the player search. Simply search for the player name or number and then select the "Write letter" option. Then follow the instructions given to compose and send your letter.<br />
If you have received a letter yourself and read it in the mailbox, you can also reply directly to the letter without searching for the player first.</p>
<p><em>TIP</em>: Letters that you send to German speaking players or that players send to you from abroad are automatically translated. Please note that translation errors may occur. You can also say "Repeat" at any time if you don't understand something correctly.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT</em>: Players can disable the letter feature to stop receiving letters from other players. Say “Disable letters” if you do not want to receive letters from other knights. When other players are searching for you, the option to write a letter will also no longer be announced.</p>
<h2 id="trading">Trading</h2>
<p>The trade feature allows knights to exchange resources safely. You can either propose a trade to another knight or listen to trade offers received on the marketplace and then decide whether to accept or reject them.</p>
<h3 id="proposing-trade">Proposing Trade</h3>
<p>To make an offer to another knight, use the player search again to search for a knight by name or player number. Then select the "Suggest trade" option.<br />
You now have the option of selecting an item that you would like to offer the player. Here you can name everything you own directly. Navigation via the backpack is not possible.<br />
If you name an item that you do not own, the system will notify you.<br />
In the next step, you say the quantity you want to offer. Then you select the resource you would like in return and then state the quantity again.<br />
Finally, you will hear a summary of the offer again and then have the option of sending the offer to the player. The goods you have offered will be deducted immediately and the player will then have six hours to accept or reject the offer via the marketplace.<br />
If there is no response within six hours, the goods you have offered will automatically be delivered to your mailbox as a package from the Royal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT</em>: You can send a maximum of 5 trade offers at the same time. It does not matter whether you send 5 offers to the same player or to different players.</p>
<h3 id="marketplace">Marketplace</h3>
<p>If you have received offers yourself, you can say "Marketplace" at any time to listen to them and decide whether you want to accept them. The skill will also tell you if there is a new trade offer on the marketplace.<br />
After you say "Marketplace", the latest offer will be announced to you. You will then have the option to accept it or reject the trade.<br />
If you enter into a trade, it will take about an hour for the package with the goods from the Royal Chamber of Commerce to arrive in your mailbox. If you reject it, the knight who made you the offer will receive his goods back from the Royal Chamber of Commerce within 10 minutes in the form of a package in the mailbox.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT</em>: If you try to accept a trade and you don't have the resources, the trade proposal will be automatically rejected, so there is no need to check if you can make the trade.</p>
<h2 id="combat-tournaments">Combat Tournaments</h2>
<p>You can also compete against other knights in tournaments in various disciplines. Combat tournaments are always announced 15 minutes before the start in Skill and in the Dark Forest. They start on the hour and then last 30 minutes. As with hunting tournaments, participation costs a few diamonds.<br />
To register your knight, simply say “combat tournament” after the announcement. You will then find out how many diamonds you would have to pay and can decide whether you want to take part.<br />
So that every player has the same chance regardless of their maximum energy, the first 25 fights after the start of the combat tournament count as tournament fights and do not cost you any energy. In the combat tournament, you also fight in your combat environment. This means that the search for opponents takes place, as in a regular fight, based on your ranking position and either the normal or random combat mode is used.<br />
To start a tournament fight, simply say “fight” or “quick fight” after the tournament has started. In the first tournament fight, you will then hear the task that has to be mastered in this tournament.<br />
If you missed the combat tournament task at the start, you can say "combat tournament" at any time during the tournament. You will then be told the task and you will also find out who is currently on the winner's podium.<br />
If you have no tournament fights left before the 30 minutes are up, you will be notified after the last tournament fight that you have completed all tournament fights. If you say "combat tournament" during the tournament, you will also find out how many tournament fights you have left and how long the tournament will last. Make sure to complete your tournament fights before the 30 minutes are up.</p>
<p>During a combat tournament, a few special rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>In tournament battles, serfs cannot be stolen by other knights</li>
<li>Tournament battles do not count towards your honor points, so you cannot gain or lose honor points in tournament battles</li>
<li>Tournament battles do not earn your knight experience points</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, a tournament fight is treated like a regular fight. This means that potions and other items also have a normal effect on your knight's characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="awards-ceremony-1">Awards Ceremony</h3>
<p>After the end of the combat tournament, you will hear an announcement in the skill. Then say “combat tournament” to hear the award ceremony.<br />
As with the hunting tournaments, all diamonds used will be divided among the winners. The first place winner receives 50%, the second place winner 40% and the third place winner 10% of the diamonds.</p>
<p><em>TIP</em>: If you are not sure whether there is a combat tournament taking place, you can simply say “combat tournament” at any time. The award ceremony will only be available until the next combat tournament is announced, otherwise you will be offered the opportunity to register.</p>
<h2 id="orders">Orders</h2>
<p>At the beginning you already learned that Knight Manager is based on a round system. The core element of each round, i.e. a season, is the order.<br />
  When you reach level 50, your knight is automatically assigned to one of the following three orders:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lazarus Order</li>
<li>The Meridian Order</li>
<li>The Merciful Order</li>
</ul>
<p>As an order member, it is your job to win the season together with the other brothers. The order that has collected the most order points at the end wins the season and a new era begins.<br />
You can collect a maximum number of points for your order per day based on your level. Each additional level allows you to collect one more order point per day. So, for example, if you have reached level 100, you can collect a maximum of 100 order points per day.</p>
<p>The following actions in the game earn you and your order points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Winning fights</li>
<li>Killing Orcs</li>
</ul>
<p>All Order Points that you and the other Order members collect are added to the total Order Points. To check where your Order currently stands, say "My Order". To check your Order Points, say "My Order Points" instead.<br />
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: When you have reached the maximum of your daily Order Points, you will also be informed of this in the skill.</p>
<h3 id="special-achievements-for-more-order-points">Special Achievements for more Order Points</h3>
<p>In order for your order to be able to effectively assert itself against the others, there are other ways to gain additional points for your order in addition to collecting daily order points in battle or the Dark Forest.<br />
The following special achievements will give your order additional points regardless of your daily order points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Killing the Orc King: 50,000 Order Points</li>
<li>Defeating the dragon in the dragon cave: 100,000 Order Points</li>
<li>Defeating the evil magician Azrael: 250,000 Order Points</li>
<li>Member of the first-place guild in the knight games: 100 Order Points</li>
<li>Member of the second-placed guild in the knight games: 50 Order Points</li>
<li>Member of the third-placed guild in the knight games: 25 Order Points</li>

<p>In the Order Hall, all members of an order have the opportunity to carry out a number of upgrades together, from which all the brothers of the order then benefit. The upgrades are started as soon as the required resources have been collected.<br />
To find out which upgrades have already been carried out or which are currently being improved, say "Order Hall". In the Order Hall, you can also choose one of the three upgrades yourself and donate gold or serfs for it.<br />
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: If you donate more than was required for the selected upgrade, only the required amount will be deducted from you. So, for example, if an upgrade requires 100,000 gold pieces, but you donate 200,000, only 100,000 gold will be deducted from you.<br />
Below you will find an overview of the order upgrades currently available.</p>
<h4 id="shrine-of-luck">Shrine of Luck</h4>
<p>Increases the base luck of all brothers by 1% per level</p>
<ul>
<li>Available levels: Unlimited</li>
<li>Required resources: Gold</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="monument-of-haste">Monument of Haste</h4>
<p>Increases the base speed of all Order Brothers by 1% per level</p>
<ul>
<li>Available levels: Unlimited</li>
<li>Required resources: Gold</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="school-of-servants">School of Servants</h4>
<p>Increases the chance of training serfs in the Arrow Factory in Arrow Maker by 1% per level</p>
<ul>
<li>Available levels: 50</li>
<li>Required resources: Serfs</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, to hear the calculation of the total value of one of your knight's attributes, you can say "My Strength" or any other attribute at any time.</p>
<h3 id="season-transition">Season Transition</h3>
<p>If the current season has reached a duration of 210 days, the current season ends and a new era begins. All knights and the rankings are reset and the fight for overall victory begins again. However, a few things will remain with your knight even after a new season starts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free tickets in your backpack</li>
<li>Diamonds</li>
<li>Combat skills</li>
<li>Combat Bonus Attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the combat bonus properties must first be unlocked after a new season has started. Each skill point unlocks three bonus properties for the selected attribute. You will also always hear how many bonuses you can still unlock after you have awarded a skill point or said “My combat bonus properties”. In addition, you can only buy new bonus properties in the shop once you have unlocked all the old bonuses for the corresponding bonus. The “Chains”, “Feather Bed”, “Balanced Food and “Docility” bonuses do not need to be unlocked.<br />
If your knight has more energy than his maximum energy when the season changes, this will also be carried over. Otherwise, you will start the new season with your maximum energy.<br />
Under certain circumstances, other items will also be carried over into a new season. If this is the case, this will be announced in good time on the <a href="https://www.knight-manager.com/">Knight Manager website</a> in the “News” section.</p>
<h2 id="provincial-battle">Provincial Battle</h2>
<p>The provincial battles take place every Sunday from 12 noon to 10 pm CET. The three orders fight for a province, which gives the order that wins the provincial battle an advantage in the game.<br />
There are four provinces in total, which are fought for in turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Darkshore: 25% discount at the blacksmith</li>
<li>Highlands: +10% experience gain (not when hunting in the Dark Forest)</li>
<li>Swamps of Sorrow: 20% discount in the hunting lodge</li>
<li>Plaguelands: +15% gold per hour from your serfs</li>
</ul>
<p>The selection of provinces is not random, but continuous. For example, if there was a fight for the Plaguelands, the following week there will be a fight for the Darkshore again. This makes it possible for an order to hold several provinces.</p>
<h3 id="flow-of-the-provincial-battle">Flow of the Provincial Battle</h3>
<p>After the provincial battle has started, you can simply say “provincial battle” to start a battle or to find out which order is currently in which position.<br />
Each provincial battle costs you one provincial coin. You receive provincial coins every Sunday after the end of the provincial battle or sometimes as a gift from the king after winning a regular battle. How many provincial coins you get depends on the placement of your order in the last provincial battle:</p>
<ul>
<li>First place order: 30 provincial coins</li>
<li>Second place order: 40 provincial coins</li>
<li>Third place order: 50 provincial coins</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out how many provincial coins you currently have at any time via your backpack. Alternatively, you can also say "My provincial coins" directly.<br />
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: You only receive provincial coins after the end of a provincial battle if you have not yet exceeded the limit of 100 coins. In addition, if the provincial coins you receive after the provincial battle exceed the limit of 100, you will only receive the difference in provincial coins. However, it is possible to collect more than 100 coins through gifts from the king after winning battles.</p>
<p>The placement of your order in the provincial battle is determined by the provincial tokens you receive for winning provincial battles. After each provincial battle you win, you have the choice of securing the tokens or continuing to fight.<br />
If you continue to fight, your combat values drop by 10% for each additional battle that you do not lose, up to a maximum of 80%. If you lose while continuing to fight or secure the tokens, you will fight in the next provincial battle with your normal starting attributes.<br />
Despite the risk, there is a decisive advantage to continuing to fight: after winning the second provincial battle in a row, you get more provincial tokens than if you had first won a provincial battle, secured the token and then fought and won another provincial battle.</p>
<p>The search for opponents in the provincial battle is random, but only opponents from the competing orders are found. This means that you may also be fighting against the strongest knight from another order. You should therefore carefully consider whether to continue fighting or to secure the tokens.</p>
<p>There are also a few special rules that apply to provincial battles:</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not receive any honor points for winning provincial battles and you do not lose any for losing provincial battles</li>
<li>Tag team partners do not support you in the provincial fight</li>
<li>You cannot steal serfs from other knights in provincial battles</li>
<li>Provincial battles do not cost you energy</li>
</ul>
<p><em>IMPORTANT</em>: Potions and other items have a normal effect on your knight's characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="awards-ceremony-2">Awards Ceremony</h3>
<p>The winner of the province battle will be announced automatically in the skill after it ends at 10 p.m CET. The winning order will then hold the province until it is fought over again and the order loses the battle.</p>
<h2 id="workplace">Workplace</h2>
<p>In the workplace, your knight can create new items from existing resources at the workbench or cooking pot from level 60. The prerequisite for this is that he has learned the required blueprint or recipe to create the item.<br />
Recipes and blueprints, more generally known as scrolls, can be found randomly in many places in the game. To check which scrolls your knight currently has, navigate to the “Scrolls” category in the backpack. This will only be announced to you if you also have scrolls.<br />
To learn a blueprint or recipe, you must use the corresponding item in the backpack. Your knight then learns the instructions for creating the item and the scroll disappears from your backpack.<br />
Some scrolls require a certain number of engineering or cooking points. Both skills are increased when you create items in the workplace. Food is produced at the cooking pot, while all other items are produced at the workbench.<br />
At the cooking pot or workbench you can also find out which items your knight can currently create. Select an item to start creating it. You will then also hear the ingredients needed to make it.</p>
<p><em>TIP</em>: To get to the workbench or cooking pot, you don't have to say "workplace" every time. You can also say "workbench" or "cooking pot" directly instead.</p>

<h2 id="dragon-rock">Dragon Rock</h2>
<p>The ascent to the Dragon Rock was blocked for many ages, but now the king has made a difficult decision to open it up again, as he sees this as the only way to defend ourselves as a community against the dragons if they come to haunt our kingdom. From level 80, your knight can climb the Dragon Rock and visit the mountain peak, the dragon cave and the dragon's nest.<br />
To get to the Dragon Rock, simply say "Dragon Rock". Sometimes you will come across an old lady who can tell you exciting stories about the dragons from eras long past.</p>
<h3 id="mountain-top">Mountain Top</h3>
<p>Even back then, some knights saw a special attraction in luring dragons into the kingdom to challenge themselves. To do this, they placed a lot of riches on the top of the mountain, primarily gold.<br />
Now that the Dragon Rock is open again, it is once again possible to lure a dragon. The prerequisite for this is that there are enough gold pieces on the mountain top.<br />
To get to the mountain top and deposit gold yourself, say "Dragon Rock" followed by "mountain top". Alternatively, you can also say "mountain top" directly.<br />
Then you can decide whether you want to deposit gold pieces yourself.<br />
After you have deposited gold on the mountain top, you will also hear a rough estimate of how many gold pieces are already on the mountain. How many gold pieces are ultimately required in total to lure a dragon into the kingdom is not known.</p>
<p>If you have Thorium Arrows and have them equipped, you will have the opportunity to shoot at the dragon every time it attacks. Thorium Arrows are the only weapon that can penetrate the massive dragon scales and thus gradually damage the dragon. Sometimes you will also receive a dragon scale if you hit the dragon in a certain spot with your Thorium Arrow.</p>
<h3 id="dragon's-lair">Dragon's Lair</h3>
<p>If the dragon has been sufficiently injured with thorium arrows in the Dark Forest, it will retreat to the dragon's lair. All knights who have a scale shield and have equipped it can then enter the dragon's lair to fight the dragon and try to defeat it. Scale shields are made from, among other things, the dragon scales that you can loot from dragon attacks in the Dark Forest. You also need the scale shield blueprint before you can craft the item at the workbench.<br />
To get to the dragon's lair, you can say "Dragon's lair" at any time. You will also receive an announcement in the skill when the dragon has retreated there. Even if the dragon is not in the lair, you can enter it. You will then hear a notification that the lair is currently deserted.</p>
<p><em>TIP</em>: As long as you have more than one scale shield equipped, you may be able to find a dragon egg during the dragon fight.</p>
<p>Whoever can defeat the dragon in battle will receive a handsome reward and a blueprint for a dragon saddle.</p>
<h3 id="dragon's-nest-and-raising-a-dragon">Dragon's Nest and Raising a Dragon</h3>
<p>The Dragon's Nest is the place on Dragon Rock where you can raise your own dragon. Dragons are very powerful and can be a great help to you in battle and hunting in the Dark Forest. However, they also devour huge amounts of food, which is why you should think carefully about whether and when you want to raise a dragon.</p>
<p>To start raising dragons, you first need a dragon egg. You can find this in the dragon lair, trade it with other players for resources or, very rarely, find it in a treasure chest.<br />
If you have a dragon egg in your backpack, you can simply say “dragon nest”. You will then be asked if you want to put the egg in a free nest.<br />
After you have put the egg in the nest, you should regularly visit the dragon nest and cover the egg with a wolf hide to keep it warm. This is the only way you can hatch it. On average, hatching takes around three to four days and you need at least five wolf hides.<br />
As soon as your dragon has hatched, you should feed it regularly. Note that the bigger the dragon gets, the more food it needs. Dragon meal is particularly recommended as a food, as this keeps the dragon full for a long time, especially when it is fully grown. Any other food that your knight can eat is also suitable, but orc and wild boar meat are particularly popular.</p>
<p>When your dragon is fully grown, it can advance to higher levels. Your dragon's level determines how much damage it does to an opponent in battle if it comes to your aid. From level 7, you also have the option of putting a saddle on your dragon so you can fly with it in the Dark Forest.<br />
Your dragon's level increases automatically if you feed it enough. It can reach a maximum of level 10.<br />
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: If you don't feed your dragon for more than 24 hours, it will fly away. There will then be no way to get it back. Instead, you would have to hatch a dragon egg again and raise a new dragon. If you don't feed the dragon enough, its level can drop before it finally flies away.</p>
<h4 id="pros-and-cons-of-using-the-dragon-saddle-when-hunting-in-the-dark-forest">Pros and Cons of Using the Dragon Saddle When Hunting in the Dark Forest</h4>
<p>If you have a dragon saddle and it is equipped, your knight will automatically fly on the dragon when you say "Dark Forest". Hunting with a dragon gives you the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly faster detection of orcs</li>
<li>Dragon can burn several orcs at onceDragon sometimes eats orcs in the Dark Forest to satisfy his own hunger. This may mean you need less food for him.</li>
<li>You are spared from a dragon attack</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the advantages that the dragon brings you in the Dark Forest, there are also some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't find any objects in the forest</li>
<li>You will not find any items from killed orcs</li>
<li>You cannot loot dragon scales from a dragon attack because the dragon in the forest does not attack you</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="advantages-of-the-dragon-in-battle">Advantages of the Dragon in Battle</h4>
<p>As already mentioned, the dragon can sometimes come to your aid in battle. You cannot influence when this happens.<br />
If your dragon appears in a battle and its fire catches the enemy, it will cause between 1.5 and 15 times the damage, depending on its level. Each level of your dragon increases the multiplication of your regular damage by 1.5.</p>
<h2 id="castle">Castle</h2>
<p>The castle is the king's residence. You can only enter the castle if you have an invitation. Say "castle" to go to the castle. If you do not have an invitation, you will be turned away.<br />
You can receive invitations from the king randomly in the game for outstanding achievements. It is not known which achievements the king appreciates and considers special. However, you will be informed in the skill when you receive an invitation.<br />
You can check whether you currently have an invitation if you say "castle" and you are offered entry.</p>
