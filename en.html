<h1 id="welcome-to-knight-manager-tutorial">Welcome to the Knight Manager Tutorial</h1>
<p>This tutorial is designed to help beginners get started in the world of Knight Manager. The tutorial can be used either as a step-by-step guide to the game or as a reference for game-related matters.<br />
To quickly navigate to a section, use the table of contents at the top of this page.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-knight-manager">What is Knight Manager?</h2>
<p>Knight Manager is an audio-based game for Amazon Alexa devices. The game is controlled exclusively through voice commands. The interaction always takes place with your Echo device and the Knight Manager Alexa skill. In addition to the game, there is also a [website](https://www.knight-manager.com/) where you can gather information about your knight, view the battle and hunting rankings, and find news about the game. It also provides organized information about provinces, orders, and legends. If you're currently feeling lost, don't worry. We haven't even started the actual game yet. :-)<br />
If you don't own an Echo device, you can alternatively play the game through the Alexa app on your smartphone, tablet, or Windows PC. However, there are some limitations in this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>You won't be able to make in-skill purchases, such as buying diamonds.</li>
<li>The Dark Forest and automatic battles may not work or have limited functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, it is recommended to get an Echo device if you plan to play the game for an extended period and want to be successful.<br />
Sometimes during the game, you may not want to listen to the entire output of a given voice command. You can skip the output at any time by simply giving a new command. By doing this, you will only miss the audio output, as the calculations for that point in the game have already been completed. It is not necessary to let all outputs play through every time.<br />
If you ever didn't understand something, you can always have the output repeated. Just say "Repeat."</p>
    
<h2 id="creating-knights">Creating a Knight</h2>
<p>First, we need to create a knight, which will be your character that you'll play with. To do this, simply open the skill on your Echo device by saying, "Alexa, open Knight Manager." If you're using a different wake word, use that instead of "Alexa." Alternatively, on Echo devices with an action button, you can also give a voice command after pressing the button.<br />
Once the skill is opened, you'll hear the sound of a sword followed by a brief introduction. Now, follow the steps described there to give your knight a name. Afterward, your individual character will be created and you're ready to go.<br />
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: If you deactivate the skill and later reactivate it, a new knight will be created. So be careful with commands like "Deactivate Knight Manager," as Alexa will execute it without confirmation.</p>    

<h2 id="linking-knights-with-your-amazon-account">Linking Your Knight to Your Amazon Account</h2>
<p>Before you proceed, it's recommended to link your knight to your Amazon account. This has the advantage of earning you 10 diamonds as a reward for the account link every day, and it allows you to view your profile on the website later on. Additionally, linking your knight to your Amazon account provides an extra layer of security because if you deactivate and reactivate the skill, you can restore your knight by simply linking the skill to your Amazon account again.<br />
To link the skill to your account, open the Alexa app on your smartphone or tablet, go to the RitterManager skill page, and select "Settings." Then choose "Link Account" and follow the on-screen instructions on your device.</p>
<p><e3>IMPORTANT</e3>: In some cases, re-linking your Amazon account may not restore your knight but create a new one. If this is the case, you can contact the developers using the <a href="https://www.knight-manager.com/en/contact" target="_blank">contact form</a>.</p>
<h1 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h1>
<p>Now that everything is ready to get started, it's time to get a first overview of your knight and the world of Knight Manager in general.</p>
<h2 id="attributes-of-your-knight">Attributes of your Knight</h2>
<p>An essential part of the game is to continuously improve your knight's attributes, strengthening him for future challenges such as adventures or battles and ultimately leading him to success. To hear an overview of the characteristics, simply say "My knight". You will then have the option to learn more about the combat values or the hunting values. Alternatively, you can also say directly "My combat values" or "My hunting values".</p>
<h3 id="combat-attributes">Combat Attributes</h3>
<p>Your knight's combat attributes are the foundation for successful battles in the arena. Your knight has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health points: Health points determine how much damage your knight can take before he is defeated in a fight.
</li>
<li>Strength: The higher your strength, the more damage you do when you hit your opponent.
</li>
<li>Defense: Defense is the opposite attribute to strength. The higher it is, the less damage your opponent can do to you with one hit.</li>
<li>Luck: The higher the luck, the more likely you are to hit your opponent.</li>
<li>Speed: The higher your speed, the higher the chance you have of dodging your opponent. In addition, high speed gives you a higher chance of starting the fight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luck and speed also help you to get a small bonus to your damage or to reduce your opponent's damage a little. A good balance of your combat values ​​is therefore very important.</p>
<p>If you want to ask about one of these combat values, just say "My strength" or any other attribute to find out more about it. This will give you the exact breakdown between the base value, the additional points from bonus properties or temporary effects (e.g. from food), as well as the blacksmith upgrades for strength and defense and the upgrades in the Order Hall for luck and speed. This also means you don't have to listen to all the other values ​​if you only want to check a specific one.</p>
<h3 id="hunting-attributes">Hunthing Attributes</h3>
<p>In addition to combat, there is another discipline in the game in which you can train your knight, the hunt in the dark forest. The following attributes can be trained here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakthrough power: Breakthrough power is used to calculate the damage you do when you hit an enemy while hunting.</li>
<li>Aiming: The higher the aiming, the more likely it is to hit an opponent while hunting.</li>
<li>Reading tracks: The better you are at reading tracks, the more often you will find an opponent while hunting.</li>
</ul>
<p>As in combat, a good distribution of points is crucial for successful results in hunting. The hunting characteristics can be queried at any time using the “My hunting values” command.</p>
<h3 id="special-abilities">Special Abilities</h3>
<p>In addition to the combat and hunting attributes, there are other special skills that your knight can acquire. Here, too, a distinction is made between combat and hunting. We will look at the skills in more detail later when we look at the shop and the hunting lodge.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-attributes">Bonus Attributes</h3>
<p>To help your knight succeed even more effectively, you can equip him with powerful bonus attributes. These either increase the attributes for combat or hunting by a few points or give you another advantage. Bonus attributes for combat are bought in the shop, those for hunting in the hunting lodge. The sections “Shop” and “Hunting lodge” provide more detailed information on the available bonus attributes.</p>
<h3 id="combat-class">Combat Class</h3>
<p>Finally, there is one last characteristic of your knight, the so-called combat class (rank). Each combat class gives your knight an advantage and a special combat title (e.g. corporal). This can be heard later in many places in the game, for example in fights in the arena or when another player is looking for your knight.<br />
  At the beginning, your character does not have a special combat title and is therefore not assigned to a combat class. Assignment to a class takes place every Wednesday at 12 noon CET during the combat class evaluation. Your game activity determines which combat class your knight is assigned to. The more you do in the game, the more active you are and the better you will do in the combat class evaluation. Everything that requires a command in the game counts as activity. Dark forest or automatic combat also count slightly towards game activity.<br />
<em>ATTENTION</em>: Combat classes are dynamic and you can drop from a high to a lower one if you have been less active in a week. So if you want to keep your combat class or want to gradually move up, you should be accordingly active in the game.<br />
There are a total of 14 combat classes that give you the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scout: More experience in daily adventures</li>
<li>Corporal: Adventures cost your knight less energy</li>
<li>Sergeant: 5% more speed</li>
<li>Senior Sergeant: 5% more luck</li>
<li>First Sergeant: 10% discount at the blacksmith</li>
<li>Knight: More honor points by winning battles</li>
<li>Bloodguard: 5% more defense</li>
<li>Legionnaire: 10% more experience points in battles</li>
<li>Centurion: 5% more strength</li>
<li>Chapion: More diamonds for gifts from the king</li>
<li>Commander: 10% more gold per hour from your serfs</li>
<li>General: Allows you to purchase and use the epic combat ability “Bow Shot”</li>
<li>Warlord: Allows you to purchase and use the epic combat ability “Drain Life”</li>
<li>High Warlord: Allows you to purchase and use the epic combat ability “Curse of Agony”</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also check how active you are at the moment. To do this, simply say "My activity". You will then hear your activity rank. This determines how many combat class points you can receive in the combat class evaluation. Your combat class is then determined based on these combat class points. Unlike the activity, you cannot check the combat class points.<br />
  There are 14 of these activity ranks in total. However, your activity rank does not necessarily determine which combat class you will be promoted to or whether you will be relegated. However, you should make sure to reach at least an activity rank of 5 or higher, as 10% of the combat class points you have collected so far are lost every Wednesday and you are therefore highly unlikely to be relegated.</p>
<h2 id="other-important-building-blocks">Other Important Building Blocks</h2>
<p>In addition to the combat, hunting, and bonus characteristics, there are some other values ​​and building blocks of the game that are important for you and your knight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level: For every level your knight gains, you receive a skill point. You can use this to improve one of the attributes for combat. The level increases when you collect experience points. You receive these in combat, in daily adventures or in the black tower. One skill point improves the base value by 10 points, with the exception of health points, which increase by 20 per point.</li>
<li>Hunting Level: As in combat, once you reach a new hunting level, you can spend a skill point on a hunting trait. The hunting level increases as you gain experience points while hunting in the dark forest.</li>
<li>Honor: Your honor points determine your ranking. The more you have, the better your ranking in the knight rankings. You get honor points by winning battles. If you lose a battle, however, you also lose some honor points.</li>
<li>Gold: This is the main currency in the game. There is no limit to how much gold you can have.</li>
<li>Serfs(Servants): Serfs produce new gold for you every hour. You can steal serfs from other knights in battle, for example, or get them in the Dark Tower, at the fair, or during daily adventures and in the dark forest.</li>
<li>Arrow Maker: The arrow makers produce arrows for you every hour, which are needed for hunting in the dark forest. You can find out more about the arrow makers in the “Arrow Factory” section.</li>
<li>Energy: Many actions in the game cost your knight energy points. You get additional energy every hour, unless you have reached the maximum possible energy. Say "my energy" for more information. You can also buy energy at any time with diamonds and even beyond your maximum energy.</li>
<li>Diamonds: Diamonds are very valuable. They can be found in the game or bought with real money. With them you can, for example, unlock upgrades at the blacksmith without having to wait, buy bonus features and skills in the shop or recharge your knight with new energy if you don't want to wait for the next hour.</li>
<li>Player number: This number uniquely identifies your knight and helps with technical problems or when searching for players if another knight cannot find you using your name. It is best to write down this number so that you have it to hand in case of emergency.</li>
</ul>
<p>To check one of these values, say "my gold" or any of the other values ​​mentioned. You will then receive some useful information about it.<br />
<em>IMPORTANT</em>: To check your ranking position and your honor points, say "my combat division". The commands "honor", "my honor points" or "my honor" will not be accepted.</p>
<h3 id="seasons">Seasons</h3>
<p>To ensure that things don't get boring in Knight Manager, the game is round-based. A round is referred to as a season. Each season lasts 210 days. This gives every player the opportunity to compete under fair conditions, even against long-standing players. The central component of the season's progression is the order. The "Orders" section goes into detail about the end of a season and the start of a new season.</p>
<h3 id="leaderboard">Leaderboard</h3>
<p>Here is some information about the ranking system in Knight Manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Knight Ranking is divided into four leagues: League A, B, C and D</li>
<li>Honor points determine your place in the rankings</li>
<li>League A includes the top 50 players based on honor points</li>
<li>League B includes places 51 to 150 measured by honor points, so there are a total of 100 places in League B</li>
<li>League C includes places 151 to 300 measured by honor points, so there are a total of 150 places in League C</li>
<li>League D includes all other players. The ranking here is also determined by the honor points.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to find out the best knights in the skill, just say “Top 10”. Alternatively, you have the option of viewing the rankings clearly on the Knight Manager website.</p>
<h4 id="special-features-of-the-rookie-rank">Special features of the rookie rank</h4>
<p>As a newcomer, you only compete with the players who are in the rookie rankings with you. This gives you the opportunity to fight in a fair environment as a beginner and to try things out in peace. Unlike the regular rankings, the rookie rankings have a few special features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players from the regular rankings cannot attack you, even if they are specifically looking for you</li>
<li>The rookie ranking includes its own four leagues A to D</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, as a beginner, you can interact with other players from the regular rankings as normal. From the next season, you will automatically play in the regular rankings.</p>
<h1 id="core-gameplay-elements">Core Gameplay Elements</h1>
<p>Now that you know about your knight's attributes, we can now focus on the important things in the everyday life of a knight manager. The core gameplay elements of the game are explained in detail below. If you already have some experience and are looking for a specific place or building block of the game, just use the navigation at the top of this page.</p>
<h2 id="adventures">Adventures</h2>
<p>Now that you know the basics, it's time to start with the daily routine of the Knight Manager, and this usually starts with a daily adventure.<br />
The daily adventures are a small story line in the game. The process is always the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every day at 12 noon CET there is a new adventure if you successfully master the current one</li>
<li>AAdventures begin with a short story and end with a fight against a fictional character, i.e. an NPC</li>
<li>Each adventure brings you a small reward such as gold, diamonds or serfs as well as some experience points</li>
</ul>
<p>To go on the daily adventure, simply say "adventure". Your knight will now go in search of an adventure and the actual story begins. Each attempt costs your knight 5 energy points, provided you have not yet been assigned a combat class. From combat class 2 (Corporal) onwards, only 2 energy points are deducted.<br />
If you are unsuccessful in an adventure, you can simply try again. You only have to wait until the next day if you have successfully mastered the adventure and you can go on a new adventure.<br />
If you have gone up a level after completing an adventure, you can also immediately distribute a skill point.</p>
<h3 id="prestige-mode">Prestige Mode</h3>
<p>There are currently 100 adventures in Knight Manager. So that you can continue to go on daily adventures even after completing the 100th adventure, the so-called prestige mode comes into play after adventure 100.<br />
In prestige mode, the story line starts again from the beginning, but the rewards are 20% higher and the enemies are a bit stronger.</p>
<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>Now that you've learned about the adventures, it's important to get to grips with the core part of the game: combat. Battles take place in the arena and you fight against other players in your area on the leaderboard. Winning battles earns you honor points, which you can use to improve your position on the leaderboard, as well as experience points, which are important for leveling up. When you lose battles, you always lose a few honor points, but you still get experience points.<br />
To start a battle, just say "battle" or "fight". Like the adventures, each battle costs 5 energy points.</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-a-battle">Structure of a Battle</h3>
<p>A fight consists of three turns. So everyone has three rounds to make it clear to the opponent who is in charge.<br />
However, if you or your opponent inflicts more damage than the opponent's health points, the fight ends early. Otherwise, at the end of the fight, the remaining percentage of your knights' total health points decides. So, for example, if your opponent has 100 health points and you inflict a total of 20 damage on him, but he only inflicts 10 damage on you with 100 health points, you win the fight because you still have 90% of your health points left, while your opponent only has 80%. If one of the opponents manages to inflict more than 100 damage before the end of the four rounds, the fight ends early and the one who was able to take all of the opponent's health points wins.<br />
After the fight, you will hear how many honor points you have won or lost, how much experience you have gained, and whether you were able to steal any serfs from your opponent. If you have leveled up, you can also assign a skill point.<br />
<em>TIP</em>: You can also say "My Level" at any time to find out if you still have free skill points left.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT</em>: If you start a fight and lose, no serfs can be stolen from you. However, if someone attacks you, serfs can be stolen from you. After opening the skill, you will find out if you were attacked while you were away.</p>
<h3 id="king's-gifts">Kings's Gifts</h3>
<p>Sometimes the king will reward you with a small gift after you win a battle. These gifts contain either diamonds, tickets for the fair or provincial coins for the provincial battle. You can find out more about byes in the “Fair” section and about provincial coins in the “Provincial Battle” section.</p>
<h3 id="combat-modes">Combat Modes</h3>
<p>There are two combat modes in total, which determine in which environment an opponent is sought based on your ranking position:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal: Here an opponent is searched for in the range of plus or minus 10 places based on your ranking position</li>
<li>Random opponent: Here an opponent is searched for in the range of plus or minus 100 places based on your ranking position</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot influence whether the random or normal mode is used. However, the normal battle mode is used more and more.</p>
<h3 id="quick-battle">Quick Fight</h3>
<p>You've probably already noticed that a single fight takes a long time for the audio output. If you want things to go faster, you can also use the "quick fight" command. This ensures that only who you are fighting against and whether you won or lost is announced. As with a regular fight, you also receive a report at the end about the honor points you have gained or lost, the experience points you have gained and possibly about serfs you have stolen from your opponent. Gifts from the king are of course also announced.</p>
<p><em>TIP</em>: Experienced players often don't listen to the fights until the end, but start the next quick fight immediately when the battle melody sounds. This allows you to invest significantly more energy in fights in a short time and increase effectiveness.</p>
<h3 id="auto-battle">Auto Battle</h3>
<p>From level 100, you also have the option of using automatic combat. This means you don't have to say "fight" or "quick fight" every time to look for a new opponent, but can simply send your knight into the arena. He will then fight until his energy is used up or you end his stay in the arena with the command "stop".<br />
After opening the skill, you will hear a summary of your stay in the arena. Here you will find out whether you were able to improve your ranking, how many experience points you have collected and how many levels you have climbed. Then, if you were able to climb a level, you have the option of awarding one or more skill points.<br />
To start automatic combat, simply say "auto battle" or "auto fight".</p>
<h2 id="blacksmith">Blacksmith</h2>
<p>In the fundamentals, you've already heard about blacksmith upgrades. Skill points aren't the only way to improve your knight's attributes. They just form the basis of your stats. Strength and defense can be increased by upgrading your sword and armor at the blacksmith. To visit the blacksmith, just say "blacksmith".<br />
You will then be greeted by the blacksmith and can choose one of the following upgrades:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sword: Each level you upgrade your sword increases your base strength by 1%</li>
<li>Armor: Each level you upgrade your armor increases your base defense by 1%</li>
<li>Accommodations: With each level you upgrade your accommodations, you can accommodate 125 more serfs</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, to hear what your base stats are, just say "My Strength" or another attribute. You will also hear by what percentage the base stat is increased by upgrades at the blacksmith. To hear how many serfs you can currently accommodate, say "My Gold".</p>
<p>Upgrades at the blacksmith are paid for with gold. The higher the level of an upgrade, the more expensive it becomes. As a reminder: serfs produce new gold pieces for you every hour. You should therefore make sure that you have a good cushion of serfs, especially at the beginning, and also expand your accommodation a little so that you can accommodate the serfs. Otherwise, serfs that you receive in the tower or in battle, for example, would be lost because they cannot find space in your accommodation if it is already full.<br />
The higher the level of an upgrade at the blacksmith, the longer it takes. An upgrade takes no longer than 12 hours at most. If you have reached this value for the duration of an upgrade, the time that the upgrade takes does not increase at the next level.<br />
If you do not want to wait for an upgrade to be completed, you can also unlock it directly with a small amount of diamonds. This also increases with the level of the upgrade, but the maximum amount required for immediate unlocking is no more than 50 diamonds.<br />
Wenn das Upgrade abgeschlossen ist, gibt dir der Schmied im Skill
When the upgrade is complete, the blacksmith will let you know in the skill. You can also say “blacksmith” at any time to see how long the upgrade will take.</p>
<h2 id="shop">Shop</h2>
<p>The shop is another important part of the game, in addition to the battle to level up and improve your position on the leaderboard. You can use it to equip your knight with new special combat skills and bonus properties.<br />
All products in the shop are paid for with diamonds. As a reminder: you can find diamonds in the game or buy them with real money at any time.<br />
The offer in the shop changes every day at 12 noon CET and is the same for every player. Each day you can always choose between one combat skill, one bonus property and one title. However, there are limits for skills and bonus properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can buy a maximum of one skill per day</li>
<li>You can buy a maximum of 15 bonus features per day</li>
</ul>
<p>The title has no effect in battle, it is only announced after the name of your knight in battles, when searching for players and in some other places in the game and thus serves solely to personalize your knight.</p>
<p>To go to the shop, just say “shop”.</p>
<h3 id="combat-skills">Combat Skills</h3>
<p>To make the battle more dynamic and exciting, you can equip your knight with special combat skills. You can only use a maximum of three skills at a time in battle. You can find out which skills your knight is currently using by saying “change skills” and then “combat skills”. Alternatively, you can also say “change combat skills” directly.<br />
Each combat skill is available in three levels, with each level increasing the effectiveness of the skill. At the beginning, the skills are only available in level 1. Due to the limit of being able to buy a maximum of one skill per day, you have to wait for levels 2 and 3 until the skill is available again in the shop.<br />
In addition, there are three skills that can only be bought and used with certain combat classes. These are called epic skills. If you have already bought one of these skills but are not currently in the required combat class, you cannot use the epic skill in battle.<br />
By default, a purchased combat skill is activated immediately. Unless you have already bought more than three different combat skills. From then on, you must first activate newly acquired skills before your knight can use them.<br />
When the skills are used in battle depends on the chance of the respective skill. Below you will find an overview of all available combat skills.</p>
